# Poly_Die
Bonus project from Professor Biediger's COSC 4370 of summer 2024.

This code will display a multi-sided die based on key inputs. The key press of the number 0 should will the texture the tetrahedron, 1 the cube, 2 the octahedron, 3 the dodecahedron, and 4 the icosahedron. Each die is created, textured, colored, and shaded using OpenGL.

The requisite shape_dictionary.py file lists all the elements need to make each of the shapes. I figured it would be easier to read then have all at once.

The png files are for the texture for its respective shape (i.e. the cube_sides.png file is for the cube die). If you wish to change the texture, you will have to modify those images or make your own (I used picpick but you could use any drawing app like Microsoft Paint).
